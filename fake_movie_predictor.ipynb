    " # B1. Data set selection and description\n",
    "For this project we are aiming to differentiate between a real movie review and a bot/AI generated review. To do this we have collected a huge number of real movie reviews which we have got from this website of cornell university called [The Movie Review Data](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/). This website has review data in different formats but since we are interested to work with subjective and qualitative data we took the ones with the text reviews. The archive file has almost 1400 review as text files sorted as positive and negative. Since we have a bottleneck in generating fake movie review we picked only 250 positive and 250 negative = 500 real movie reviews. After getting the real reviews we have tried to find the online dataset sources where we could find fake reviews but we could not find any dataset or website with text where there are fake/AI generated movie review data. So we decided to generate AI written movie reviews from an website called [inferkit](https://app.inferkit.com/generate). Since we want to make our data balanced we made a batch request of creating reviews of 500 movies which returned us with an csv file with movie name and corresponding generated review. Now we have a balanced dataset of 500+500 movie reviews and we will move to our next step."
